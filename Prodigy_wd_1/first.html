    <h1>Water Conservation : Rainwater Harvesting </h1>
    <p>As the world faces an increasingly critical need to address climate change, the impact that water conservation has on a 
     sustainable environment is undeniable. Groundwater is the primary source of freshwater that caters to the demand of 
     ever-growing domestic, agrarian and industrial sectors of the country. Over the years, it has been observed that the 
     necessity for the exploitation of groundwater resources for various everyday needs, like toileting, bathing, cleaning,
     agriculture, drinking water, industrial and ever-changing lifestyles with modernization is leading towards tremendous water wastage.</p>
     <p>Though many technological devices are being developed to minimize the water wastage, the impact will be greater if 
        every individual contributes to water conservation by minimizing or optimizing groundwater usage for daily activities. 
        Today, water conservation at individual level has become very critical.</p>
        <p>Our water resources are depleting each year. Additionally, we cannot generate artificial water and must depend on water
        sources available on our planet earth. Due to population boom and excessive need of water to suit our ever-expanding 
        modern lifestyle, water scarcity is felt all over the world. This has given rise to major concerns over water conservation.
        In this context, adopting rainwater harvesting and recharging groundwater is one of the simplest and best measures in 
        conserving water globally. This practice can efficiently be implemented in lieu of traditional water supplies that are 
        currently on the verge of tapping out.</p>
